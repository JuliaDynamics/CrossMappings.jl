    predict_point!(predictions, i, driver_values, u, w, dists, dim)

The prediction part of the convergent cross mapping algorithm.

## Algorithm

Consider the point in the delay embedding of `response` point with
time index `i`. Denote the time indices of its nearest
neighbors ``t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_{dim+1}``. Denote the scalar values
of `driver` at those time indices ``y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_{dim+1}``.

Given `distances` ``d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_{dim+1}`` from the `i`-th
point to its nearest neighbors, we compute the weights `w` from
the cross mapping algorithm ([Sugihara et al, 2012; supplementary
material, page 4](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2012/09/19/science.1227079.DC1/Sugihara.SM.pdf)). The weights `w` and coefficients `u` are stored in
pre-allocated vectors.

A prediction for the observation with time index `i` in the `driver`
timeseries, call it ``\\hat{y}(i)``, is computed as the sum

```math
\\hat{y}(i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{dim+1} w_j y_j.
```

We store the prediction ``\\hat{y}(i)`` in position `i` of the pre-allocated vector
`predictions`.


## Arguments
- **`predictions`**: A pre-allocated vector in which to store the
    prediction for the scalar value of the `driver` series.
- **`i`**: The time index of the point of the `driver` series being
    predicted. The prediction is stored in `predictions[i]`.
- **`driver_values`**: Let ``t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_{dim + 1}`` be
    the time indices of
    the nearest neighbors to the delay embedding point with time
    index `i`. `driver_values` contains the scalar values of the
    `driver` series at those time indices.
- **`u`**: A pre-allocated vector of length `dim + 1` that holds the
    normalisation coefficients for computing the weights in the
    cross mapping algorithm.
- **`w`**: A pre-allocated vector of length `dim + 1` that holds
    the computed weights for the cross mapping algorithm.
- **`dists`**: The distances from delay embedding point with time index
    `i` to its `dim + 1` nearest neighbors, in order of increasing
    distances.
- **`dim`**: The dimension of the delay embedding.

## Algorithm
Compute the cross mapping between a `driver` series and a `response` series.

## Arguments
- **`driver`**: The data series representing the putative driver process.
- **`response`**: The data series representing the putative response process.
- **`dim`**: The dimension of the state space reconstruction (delay embedding)
    constructed from the `response` series. Default is `dim = 3`.
- **`τ`**: The embedding lag for the delay embedding constructed from `response`.
    Default is `τ = 1`.
- **`ν`**: The prediction lag to use when predicting scalar values of `driver`
    fromthe delay embedding of `response`.
    `ν > 0` are forward lags (causal; `driver`'s past influences `response`'s future),
    and `ν < 0` are backwards lags (non-causal; `driver`'s' future influences
    `response`'s past). Adjust the prediction lag if you
    want to performed lagged ccm
    [(Ye et al., 2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14750).
    Default is `ν = 0`, as in
    [Sugihara et al. (2012)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/09/19/science.1227079).
    *Note: The sign of the lag `ν` is organized to conform with the conventions in
    [TransferEntropy.jl](), and is opposite to the convention used in the
    [`rEDM`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rEDM/index.html) package
    ([Ye et al., 2016](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rEDM/index.html)).*
- **`libsize`**: Among how many delay embedding points should we sample time indices
    and look for nearest neighbours at each cross mapping realization (of which there
    are `n_reps`)?
- **`n_reps`**: The number of times we draw a library of `libsize` points from the
    delay embedding of `response` and try to predict `driver` values. Equivalently,
    how many times do we cross map for this value of `libsize`?
    Default is `n_reps = 100`.
- **`replace`**: Sample delay embedding points with replacement? Default is `replace = true`.
- **`exclusion_radius`**: How many temporal neighbors of the delay embedding
    point `response_embedding(t)` to exclude when searching for neighbors to
    determine weights for predicting the scalar point `driver(t + ν)`.
    Default is `exclusion_radius = 0`.
- **`which_is_surr`**: Which data series should be replaced by a surrogate
    realization of the type given by `surr_type`? Must be one of the
    following: `:response`, `:driver`, `:none`, `:both`.
    Default is `:none`.
- **`surr_func`**: A valid surrogate function from TimeseriesSurrogates.jl.
- **`tree_type`**: The type of tree to build when looking for nearest neighbors.
    Must be a tree type from NearestNeighbors.jl. For now, this is either
    `BruteTree`, `KDTree` or `BallTree`.
- **`distance_metric`**: An instance of a `Metric` from Distances.jl. `BallTree` and `BruteTree` work with any `Metric`.
    `KDTree` only works with the axis aligned metrics `Euclidean`, `Chebyshev`,
    `Minkowski` and `Cityblock`. Default is `metric = Euclidean()` *(note the instantiation of the metric)*.
- **`correspondence_measure`**: The function that computes the correspondence
    between actual values of `driver` and predicted values. Can be any
    function returning a similarity measure between two vectors of values.
    Default is `correspondence_measure = StatsBase.cor`, which returns values on ``[-1, 1]``.
    In this case, any negative values are usually filtered out (interpreted as zero coupling) and
    a value of ``1`` means perfect prediction.
    [Sugihara et al. (2012)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/09/19/science.1227079)
    also proposes to use the root mean square deviation, for which a value of ``0`` would
    be perfect prediction.
